# Basic homepage project
This is where I started learning HTML, CSS and Java Script. 
Classes in CSS are named according to the BEM convention.


The page is comprised of a few elements: 
- navigation
- introduction with a photo that can be hidden/shown with JS
- table with a few games
- list of visited countries with photos that can be shown/hidden with JS
